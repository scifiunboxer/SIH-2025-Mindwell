College students are facing a significant rise in mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, academic stress, and social isolation. Despite this growing crisis, a major gap exists in the availability and accessibility of mental health support within higher education institutions. Key problems include:

Lack of a structured system: There is no scalable or stigma-free method for psychological intervention.

Stigma and low utilization: Students often fear judgment and therefore under-utilize existing college counseling services.

No early detection: Institutions lack tools for early identification and prevention of mental health issues.

Data vacuum: There is no centralized system for monitoring student mental health trends, preventing data-driven policy and effective resource allocation.

The project aims to address the shortcomings of generic, often paid, Western-centric mental health apps by providing a solution tailored to the specific cultural and institutional context of students in India, including regional language support.

To solve this problem, we are developing a comprehensive, open-source Digital Psychological Intervention System built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This platform will serve as a centralized, confidential, and supportive hub for student mental wellness.
The system will be composed of five integrated core modules:

AI-Guided First-Aid Support: An interactive chatbot powered by the Google Gemini API, trained to provide empathetic first-aid coping strategies and recognize signs of severe distress, gently referring students to professional help when necessary.

Confidential Booking System: A secure and private interface for students to schedule appointments with on-campus counselors or connect with a mental health helpline, removing the barrier of face-to-face booking.

Psychoeducational Resource Hub: A curated library of mental wellness resources, including videos, relaxation audio, and guides, made accessible in various regional languages to ensure cultural relevance and wider reach.

Moderated Peer Support Platform: A safe, anonymous forum where students can connect with and support one another, moderated by trained student volunteers to maintain a constructive environment.

Administrative Analytics Dashboard: An institutional-facing dashboard that provides anonymized, aggregated data on student well-being trends. This will empower the Department of Student Welfare and other stakeholders to identify key stress points, measure the effectiveness of interventions, and make informed, data-driven decisions to improve campus mental health policies.
